# PokerDiceGame
A poker dice game that I made in my APCSP class my senior year. 

There are three dice that role a 1 to a 6. The score depends on what you get from your roll: 
All dice are even = 15, 
All dice are odd = 15,
All the dice are the same = 30, 
Two dice are the same = 10, and 
If some dice can be subtracted to equal 1 = 30 

The score is added up from that roll to be printed.
